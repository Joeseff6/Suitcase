# Suitcase :city_sunrise: :airplane: :city_sunset:
A web application that provides the user with information about a inquired destination

## Link to Deployed Application :link:

_https://joeseff6.github.io/Suitcase/_

## Project Description

The purpose of the deployed application is to provide a user the ability to learn high-level details about a specified destination, whether is be national or international. 
## What to Expect From the Application

Say that you are going to travel to another country, whether it be for work or for leisure, but you don't know much about the destination you're traveling to. What is the language spoken there? What is the currency? What is the capital of that country? Is the country under lockdown due to a pandemic? That's where this application comes in handy! The user will be able to use this deployed web application to search for a destination and learn high-leveled details about said destination. Nothing too detailed, but just the right amount of knowledge to help the user feel more comfortable about where they are traveling.

This application will dynamically generate information provided by requested data from server-side APIs. A couple of features include a dynamic search history, favorite function, previous search results, choice of information the user wants to see, and more! 

### Third-Party APIs 
* jQuery
* Foundation
* Moment.js
* Google Font
* Font awesome

### Server-side APIs
* OpenWeather
* REST Countries
* Openlayer
* GeoDB
* Currency convertor
* New York Times Article 


## User Story :book:

_As a tourist,_
